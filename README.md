# Desktop De-cluttering Program in Python

This is a Desktop de-cluttering program by @tuomaskivioja which I have modified for my own use. Here are my modifications:
- If an organizational subfolder doesn't exist already, I create it
- I specifically put screenshots in their own folder since they're the main source of my desktop clutter
- I removed code for audio files since I rarely ever work with those
- Using on_any_event instead of on_modified
  
This was a great way to learn to use watchdog and general scripting practices on Mac OS. 

Check out my demo video below! I start the program, take a screenshot, place it on my desktop and the code cleans up all loose files on my desktop.
